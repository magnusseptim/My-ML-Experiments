My ML Experiments

Few ML notebooks and programs

* Linear Regression - Shame ! 
* Binary Logistic Regression - Little better
* K Nearest Neighbors - simple, but nice looking
* Random Forest (with PCA usage) - Lazy notebook 
* Language Recognition using MultinomialNB
* Product Recommendation - not so good as expected
